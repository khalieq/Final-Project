# Final-Project
Act as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts are working. If the alerts are working, you will then monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system. Then, you will report back your findings to the manager with appropriate analysis.

Red Team Analysis
Pentesting Target 1 & Target 2
Assess a vulnerable VM and verify that the Kibana rules work as expected.

Within this analysis, critical vulnerabilities are exposed of the vulnerable VM, and is shown step by step of how the pentesting has worked to gain access to each system.


Blue Team Analysis
Hardening of vulnerable VM
Implement alerts and thresholds that are determined to be effective.

This analysis contains Network Topology, description of targets, and how the monitoring of the targets are set so that the ELK can be utilized to specific point of alerts. Hardening of the systems are also shown with detailed explanation.



Network Analysis
Normal Activity vs Malicious Activity
Use Wireshark to analyze live malicious traffic on the wire

By looking at the packets within the network, found the targets whom have created custom site on the network, also found the infected machine and what they are infected with, and also found illegal downloads that were downloaded to the network.
